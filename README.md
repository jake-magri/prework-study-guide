# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation of this project is to create a interactive study guide as a web application so I can learn while doing and review my notes in a fun way. It solves the problem of having a universally accessible notes page and one that gets you started by recomending a topic to review. By doing this I learned about HTML structuring, CSS styling, JS functionality, and how to deploy code on gitlab.
